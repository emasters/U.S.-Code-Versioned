<p class="statutory-body">(a) As used in this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a &ldquo;semiconductor chip product&rdquo; is the final or intermediate form of any product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) having two or more layers of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material, deposited or otherwise placed on, or etched away or otherwise removed from, a piece of semiconductor material in accordance with a predetermined pattern; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) intended to perform electronic circuitry functions;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a &ldquo;mask work&rdquo; is a series of related images, however fixed or encoded&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor chip product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in which series the relation of the images to one another is that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip product;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a mask work is &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; in a semiconductor chip product when its embodiment in the product is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit the mask work to be perceived or reproduced from the product for a period of more than transitory duration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to &ldquo;distribute&rdquo; means to sell, or to lease, bail, or otherwise transfer, or to offer to sell, lease, bail, or otherwise transfer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to &ldquo;commercially exploit&rdquo; a mask work is to distribute to the public for commercial purposes a semiconductor chip product embodying the mask work; except that such term includes an offer to sell or transfer a semiconductor chip product only when the offer is in writing and occurs after the mask work is fixed in the semiconductor chip product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of a mask work is the person who created the mask work, the legal representative of that person if that person is deceased or under a legal incapacity, or a party to whom all the rights under this chapter of such person or representative are transferred in accordance with section 903(b); except that, in the case of a work made within the scope of a person's employment, the owner is the employer for whom the person created the mask work or a party to whom all the rights under this chapter of the employer are transferred in accordance with section 903(b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) an &ldquo;innocent purchaser&rdquo; is a person who purchases a semiconductor chip product in good faith and without having notice of protection with respect to the semiconductor chip product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) having &ldquo;notice of protection&rdquo; means having actual knowledge that, or reasonable grounds to believe that, a mask work is protected under this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) an &ldquo;infringing semiconductor chip product&rdquo; is a semiconductor chip product which is made, imported, or distributed in violation of the exclusive rights of the owner of a mask work under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For purposes of this chapter, the distribution or importation of a product incorporating a semiconductor chip product as a part thereof is a distribution or importation of that semiconductor chip product.</p>
