<p class="statutory-body-1em">A work is &ldquo;created&rdquo; when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first time; where a work is prepared over a period of time, the portion of it that has been fixed at any particular time constitutes the work as of that time, and where the work has been prepared in different versions, each version constitutes a separate work.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A work is &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority of the author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration. A work consisting of sounds, images, or both, that are being transmitted, is &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; for purposes of this title if a fixation of the work is being made simultaneously with its transmission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A &ldquo;joint work&rdquo; is a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.</p>

The term &ldquo;phonorecords&rdquo; includes the material object in which the sounds are first fixed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">&ldquo;Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works&rdquo; include two-dimensional and three-dimensional works of fine, graphic, and applied art, photographs, prints and art reproductions, maps, globes, charts, diagrams, models, and technical drawings, including architectural plans. Such works shall include works of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned; the design of a useful article, as defined in this section, shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">To perform or display a work &ldquo;publicly&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(1) to perform or display it at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(2) to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to a place specified by clause (1) or to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A &ldquo;useful article&rdquo; is an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.
