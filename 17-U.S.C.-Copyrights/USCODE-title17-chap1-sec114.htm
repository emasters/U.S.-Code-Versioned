<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording are limited to the rights specified by clauses (1), (2), and (3) of section 106, and do not include any right of performance under section 106(4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause (1) of section 106 is limited to the right to duplicate the sound recording in the form of phonorecords, or of copies of motion pictures and other audiovisual works, that directly or indirectly recapture the actual sounds fixed in the recording. The exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause (2) of section 106 is limited to the right to prepare a derivative work in which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are rearranged, remixed, or otherwise altered in sequence or quality. The exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clauses (1) and (2) of section 106 do not extend to the making or duplication of another sound recording that consists entirely of an independent fixation of other sounds, even though such sounds imitate or simulate those in the copyrighted sound recording. The exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clauses (1), (2), and (3) of section 106 do not apply to sound recordings included in educational television and radio programs (as defined in section 397 of title 47) distributed or transmitted by or through public broadcasting entities (as defined by section 118(g)): <em>Provided</em>, That copies or phonorecords of said programs are not commercially distributed by or through public broadcasting entities to the general public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) This section does not limit or impair the exclusive right to perform publicly, by means of a phonorecord, any of the works specified by section 106(4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) On January 3, 1978, the Register of Copyrights, after consulting with representatives of owners of copyrighted materials, representatives of the broadcasting, recording, motion picture, entertainment industries, and arts organizations, representatives of organized labor and performers of copyrighted materials, shall submit to the Congress a report setting forth recommendations as to whether this section should be amended to provide for performers and copyright owners of copyrighted material any performance rights in such material. The report should describe the status of such rights in foreign countries, the views of major interested parties, and specific legislative or other recommendations, if any.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
I74house report no. 94&ndash;1476<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) of Section 114 specified that the exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording are limited to the rights to reproduce the sound recording in copies or phonorecords, to prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted sound recording, and to distribute copies or phonorecords of the sound recording to the public. Subsection (a) states explicitly that <!-- PDFPage:67 -->the owner's rights &ldquo;do not include any right of performance under section 106(4).&rdquo; The Committee considered at length the arguments in favor of establishing a limited performance right, in the form of a compulsory license, for copyrighted sound recordings, but concluded that the problem requires further study. It therefore added a new subsection (d) to the bill requiring the Register of Copyrights to submit to Congress, on January 3, 1978, &ldquo;a report setting forth recommendations as to whether this section should be amended to provide for performers and copyright owners *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* any performance rights&rdquo; in copyrighted sound recordings. Under the new subsection, the report &ldquo;should describe the status of such rights in foreign countries, the views of major interested parties, and specific legislative or other recommendations, if any.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) of section 114 makes clear that statutory protection for sound recordings extends only to the particular sounds of which the recording consists, and would not prevent a separate recording of another performance in which those sounds are imitated. Thus, infringement takes place whenever all or any substantial portion of the actual sounds that go to make up a copyrighted sound recording are reproduced in phonorecords by repressing, transcribing, recapturing off the air, or any other method, or by reproducing them in the soundtrack or audio portion of a motion picture or other audiovisual work. Mere imitation of a recorded performance would not constitute a copyright infringement even where one performer deliberately sets out to simulate another's performance as exactly as possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under section 114, the exclusive right of owner of copyright in a sound recording to prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted sound recording is recognized. However, in view of the expressed intention not to give exclusive rights against imitative or simulated performances and recordings, the Committee adopted an amendment to make clear the scope of rights under section 106(2) in this context. Section 114(b) provides that the &ldquo;exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause (2) of section 106 is limited to the right to prepare a derivative work in which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are rearranged, remixed, or otherwise altered in sequence or quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Another amendment deals with the use of copyrighted sound recordings &ldquo;included in educational television and radio programs *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* distributed or transmitted by or through public broadcasting entities.&rdquo; This use of recordings is permissible without authorization from the owner of copyright in the sound recording, as long as &ldquo;copies or phonorecords of said programs are not commercially distributed by or through public broadcasting entities to the general public.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">During the 1975 hearings, the Register of Copyrights expressed some concern that an invaluable segment of this country's musical heritage&mdash;in the form of sound recordings&mdash;had become inaccessible to musicologists and to others for scholarly purposes. Several of the major recording companies have responded to the Register's concern by granting blanket licenses to the Library of Congress to permit it to make single copy duplications of sound recordings maintained in the Library's archives for research purposes. Moreover, steps are being taken to determine the feasibility of additional licensing arrangements as a means of satisfying the needs of key regional music libraries across the country. The Register has agreed to report to Congress if further legislative consideration should be undertaken.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 114(c) states explicitly that nothing in the provisions of section 114 should be construed to &ldquo;limit or impair the exclusive right to perform publicly, by means of a phonorecord, any of the works specified by section 106(4).&rdquo; This principle is already implicit in the bill, but it is restated to avoid the danger of confusion between rights in a sound recording and rights in the musical composition or other work embodied in the recording.</p>
